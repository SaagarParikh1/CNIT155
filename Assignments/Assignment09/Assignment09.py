# Program Description: This assignment is provided with a text file (input.txt) that contains 20 studentsâ€™ names and their GPAs. Write a program that reads those values from the sample file, performs statistical analysis with them, and writes the results to another text file (output.txt).
# Academic Honesty:
# I attest that this is my original work.
# I have not used unauthorized source code, either modified or unmodified.
# I have not given other fellow student(s) access to my program.
